## Environment Configuration

### 1. Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root with:

```bash
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://backend-tc-sa-v2.onrender.com/api
```

**Important Notes:**
- ✅ Backend URL is correctly configured
- ✅ No hardcoded localhost URLs found
- ✅ Axios interceptor properly handles dev/prod environments
- ✅ PDF URLs dynamically constructed for both environments

### 2. Build Configuration
The project is configured for production deployment:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview",
    "deploy:build": "npm run clean && npm run build"
  }
}
```

   ```bash
   netlify deploy --prod
   ```

   Or connect your GitHub repo to Netlify:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist`
   - Environment variables: Add `VITE_API_BASE_URL`

### Option 2: Render.com Deployment

1. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy via Render Dashboard**:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist`
   - Add environment variable: `VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://backend-tc-sa-v2.onrender.com/api`

### Option 3: Vercel Deployment

1. **Install Vercel CLI**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. **Deploy**:
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

   Or connect via Vercel Dashboard:
   - Framework: Vite
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Output directory: `dist`
   - Environment variable: `VITE_API_BASE_URL`

## Production Verification Checklist

After deployment, verify the following:

### Critical Functionality
- [ ] **User/Parent Login** - Test login flow works
- [ ] **School Login** - Test school authentication
- [ ] **School Search** - Verify schools load correctly
- [ ] **School Details** - Check all sections display properly
- [ ] **Shortlist** - Test add/remove from shortlist
- [ ] **Application Form** - Test form submission
- [ ] **PDF Viewing** - Verify admin can view student PDFs
- [ ] **School Predictor** - Test predictor with all fields
- [ ] **GPS Location** - Verify mandatory fields work
- [ ] **Routes Display** - Check transport routes show count

### API Endpoints Test
Test these critical endpoints on production:
- `GET /api/schools` - School listing
- `POST /api/users/shortlist` - Add to shortlist
- `GET /api/users/pdf/view/:id` - PDF viewing
- `POST /api/applications` - Application submission
- `POST /api/predict` - School predictor

### Performance Checks
- [ ] Initial page load < 3 seconds
- [ ] No console errors (warnings are OK)
- [ ] All images load properly
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness works
- [ ] Navigation between pages is smooth

---

## Known Production Configurations

### ✅ Properly Configured
1. **API Base URL**: Dynamically set via environment variable
2. **Axios Interceptor**: Handles `/api` prefix correctly for dev/prod
3. **PDF URLs**: Constructed dynamically based on environment
4. **API Paths**: All use relative paths (no hardcoded URLs)
5. **Redirects**: `_redirects` file configured for SPA routing

### Console Logging
The application includes console.log statements for debugging:
- `🔧 Axios Base URL` - Shows API configuration
- `📤 API Request` - Logs outgoing requests
- `✅ API Response` - Logs successful responses
- `❌ API Error` - Logs error details
- `📄 PDF URL` - Shows PDF viewing URL

**Note**: These logs are helpful for debugging in production but can be removed if desired. They don't affect functionality.

---

## Troubleshooting

### If PDFs Don't Load
1. Check browser console for the logged PDF URL
2. Verify backend CORS settings allow your production domain
3. Ensure `VITE_API_BASE_URL` is correctly set
4. Test the PDF URL directly in browser

### If Shortlist Doesn't Work
1. Check if user is logged in
2. Verify API endpoint returns 200 status
3. Check browser console for error messages
4. Ensure backend has user's shortlist data

### If Predictor Closes Immediately
1. Check all required fields are filled
2. Look for validation errors in console
3. Verify backend predictor endpoint is responding

### If Login Confusion Persists
1. Verify header component shows distinct buttons
2. Check mobile menu displays correctly
3. Test both login flows separately

---

## Post-Deployment

### Monitoring
- Monitor backend API response times
- Check for any 404 or 500 errors
- Track user engagement with new features

### Backup Plan
Keep the previous deployment accessible in case rollback is needed.

---

## Production Build Command

To build for production:

```bash
# Clean previous builds
npm run clean

# Build optimized production bundle
npm run build

# Preview production build locally (optional)
npm run preview
```

The build output will be in the `dist/` directory.

---

## Environment-Specific Behavior

### Development (`npm run dev`)
- Uses Vite proxy to backend
- API calls go through `/api` prefix
- Hot module reloading enabled
- Console logs verbose

### Production (deployed)
- Direct API calls to backend URL
- `VITE_API_BASE_URL` used for all requests
- Optimized bundle size
- Console logs maintained for debugging

---

## Security Considerations

✅ **Already Implemented:**
- No API keys in frontend code
- Authentication tokens stored in localStorage
- CORS handled by backend
- No sensitive data exposed

⚠️ **Important:**
- Ensure backend has proper rate limiting
- Monitor for unusual API usage patterns
- Keep dependencies updated
